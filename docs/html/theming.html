    Now try to change the <code>App Surface Color</code> to <code>#000000</code> and  the <code>App Font Color</code> to  
    <code>#ffffff</code> on the editor, and voil√°: you have a Dark Theme. Click on the link below to know more about

        You can write your own theme from scratch by overriding classes on your code, you can load a pre-made custom theme from Plume's <code>Themes</code> 
        folder, or you can use the Theme Editor on the left side of this page to construct your own. When using the Theme Editor, you can just tune the 
        CSS Custom Properties using inputs, getting imediate visual feedback. Your modifications will be saved on the URL, so you can share your theme, 
        or save its URL as a documentation. You can download your theme by clicking on the "Download Theme" button or by copying its source code to a CSS file.
        Just load your Custom Theme CSS file on your application after Plume's CSS, and done. For advanced usage, please read the github's documentation.
