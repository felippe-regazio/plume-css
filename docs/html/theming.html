    Plume is builded with +100 CSS Custom Properties that can be overrided to construct a Custom Theme.
    You can write your own theme from scratch by overriding classes on your code, or you can use the Theme Editor 
    on the left side of this page.
  </p>

  <p>
    When using the Theme Editor, you can just tune the inputs to get an imediate visual feedback. 
    Your modifications will be saved on the URL, so you can share your theme, or save its URL as a documentation. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To start experimenting, try to change the <code>App Surface Color</code> to <code>#000000</code> and the <code>App Font Color</code> to  <code>#ffffff</code> 
    and voil√°, you have a dark theme. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    You can download your theme by clicking on the "Download Theme" button or by copying its source code on the "Source Code" button. 
    Now you just need to load the theme CSS file on your application 
  </p>
