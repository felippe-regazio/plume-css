    Welcome to Plume CSS, a lightweight and highly themeble CSS Micro-Framwork. Plume is meant to be the lowest design layer on your application, helping you to grow solid and change easily when needed.
    Plume was inspired by projects like Skeleton, Milligram, MiniCss and Material, encompassing practices found in all of them. Here are some Plume's most important characteristics:
    
    # ridiculously small

    # plug and play

    # highly themeble

    (if you grow from plume and using and extending its custom props, you also grows themeble)

    # completely scoped    

    # decoupled themes

    # fluid typography

    # no javascript

    # no grid system

    # no classes

    (added on pure alements, so you can extend and modify more easily addding your classes)

    # easily extensible

    # critical css for free

    # unopinionated architecture

    (there is no html imposition, the elements are styled in its pure state, you decide your html archtecture)
