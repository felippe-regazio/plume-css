  <p>
    Welcome to Plume CSS, a lightweight and highly themeable CSS Micro-Framework. Plume is meant to be the lowest design layer on your app, 
    styling native HTML. You should use Plume if you are working on a small to medium project, if you don't want to bring all the larger 
    frameworks features to your application, or if you want to code and grow your style by yourself. Plume offers a solid, highly customizable 
    and extendable start point. Plume was inspired by projects such as Skeleton, Milligram, MiniCss and Material, encompassing some practices 
    found in all of them. On this page you'll find features overview, an Interactive Theme Editor, visual reference and a list of utilities 
    and custom properties. Here are some of Plume's coolest characteristics:
  </p>
    
  <dl>
    <dt>üì¶ &nbsp; Pretty small</dt>
      <dd>
        The complete source has ~5kb gzipped, or 28 kb inflated. You can also load only the modules that you'll need, as buttons.css or form.css elements, for example.
      </dd>

    <dt>‚õî &nbsp; No JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>
        Completly javascript free. Is just pure and simple CSS. You can test it by disabling javascript and reloading this page. The theme editor wont be available, but Plume will be intact.
      </dd>        

    <dt>üîå &nbsp; Plug and play</dt>
      <dd>
        Load the lib, load your custom theme if you have one, and you're ready to go. Plume is already normalized. You can start to build your application with a minimal and solid CSS foundation.
      </dd>

    <dt>üñå &nbsp; Highly themeable</dt>
      <dd>
        70+ CSS custom properties available. Easily customizable from CSS or SCSS. Theme constructor with immediate visual feedback available (Button on the top left corner).
      </dd>

    <dt>‚àà &nbsp; Completely scoped</dt>
      <dd>
        Styles are applied under the <code>{{superclass}}</code> class, and all classes and properties are prefixed. 
        You can add plume on an existent project with no harm and no side effects on the outer scope.
      </dd>

    <dt>üíé &nbsp; Decoupled themes</dt>
      <dd>
        Custom themes are just a set of CSS Custom properties. You can load them dynamically or scope them to have multiple themes on the same application - even same page (change this page theme on the bottom left button).
      </dd>
  
    <dt>üìê &nbsp; No grid system</dt>
      <dd>
        You can easily build any kind of layout with CSS Flexbox and/or Grid. If you still prefer to use a grid system, 
        there are a plenty of them available out there (bootstrap grid, flexbox grid, etc), you choose.
      </dd>

    <dt>üéØ &nbsp; Bare Elements Styled</dt>
      <dd>
        Despite a large set of utilities, Plume applies the style on bare elements. Classes and custom attributes are used to alter the default styles and behavior. Since Plume its scoped, this wont harm your page.
      </dd>
      
  </dl>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p>
    Install with NPM (Also available with Yarn)
  </p>
  
  <pre><code>npm install plume-css</code></pre>

  <p>
    Then in your app
  </p>
  
  <pre><code>import 'plume-css'</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    Or download the package and add the css on your document:
  </p>
  
  <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="plume-css/lib/plume-all.css"&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>
    <span class="{{prefix}}text-info"><strong>Attention:</strong></span> Plume is completely scoped! So, after loading it, 
    you must add the <code>{{superclass}}</code> class on a wrapper div to apply local styles
    or on the <code>body</code> tag to apply the styles on the entire page. You can also add the <code>{{prefix}}container</code> class to have a containerized wrapper.
    For advanced loading and usage, please check the Github Documentation.
  </p>
  
  <pre><code>&lt;div class="{{superclass}}"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
