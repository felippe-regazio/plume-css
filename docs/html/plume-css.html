  <p>
    Welcome to Plume CSS, a lightweight and highly themeable CSS Micro-Framework. Plume is meant to be the lowest design layer on your app, 
    helping you to grow solid and change easily. You should use Plume if you don't want to bring all the larger frameworks features to your application, 
    or if you want to code everything by yourself and need a solid and highly customizable start point. Plume was inspired by projects such as Skeleton, Milligram, 
    MiniCss and Material, encompassing some practices found in all of them. On this page you'll find an interactive Theme Editor, features overview, 
    visual reference and a list of utilities and custom properties. Here are some of Plume's coolest characteristics:
  <p></p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>📦 &nbsp; Pretty small</dt>
        <dd>
          The complete source has ~ 5.5 kb gzipped, or 25 kb inflated. You can also load only the modules that you'll need, as buttons or form elements, for example.
        </dd>

      <dt>⛔ &nbsp; No JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>
          Completly javascript free. Is just the pure and simple CSS. You can test it by disabling javascript and reloading this page. The theme editor wont be available, but Plume will be intact.
        </dd>        
  
      <dt>🔌 &nbsp; Plug and play</dt>
        <dd>
          Load the lib, load your custom theme if you have one, and you're ready to go. Plume is already normalized. You can start to build your application with a minimal and solid design foundation.
        </dd>

      <dt>🖌 &nbsp; Highly themeble</dt>
        <dd>
         Builded with 70+ CSS custom properties (vars). Minimal and easy to extend and customize. Theme constructor with imediate visual feedback available (Button on the top left corner).
        </dd>
  
      <dt>∈ &nbsp; Completely scoped</dt>
        <dd>
          Styles are applied under the <code>plume</code> class, and custom properties are prefixed. 
          You can add plume on an existent project with no harm and no side effects on the outer scope.
        </dd>
  
      <dt>💎 &nbsp; Decoupled themes</dt>
        <dd>
          Custom themes are just a set of CSS Custom properties. You can load them dinamically or scope them to have multiple themes on the same application - even same page.
        </dd>
  
      <dt>⟷ &nbsp; Fluid typography</dt>
        <dd>
          Typography is based on Material guidelines, and scales with the viewport width. The typography global definitions are pretty easy to tune. 
        </dd>
  
      <dt>📐 &nbsp; No grid system</dt>
        <dd>
          You can easily build any kind of layout with CSS Flexbox and/or Grid. If you still prefer to use a grid system lib, 
          there are a plenty of them avaible out there, there is no need to reinvent the wheel.
        </dd>
  
      <dt>🎯 &nbsp; No bunch of classes</dt>
        <dd>
          Despite a large set of utilities, Plume applies the style on bare elements. Classes and custom attributes are used to alter the default style and behavior.
        </dd>

      <dt>💡 &nbsp; Lib, framework or boilerplate</dt>
        <dd>
          You can use plume as a lib, by adding it on your application as a base design layer. As a framework, by growing from Plume, 
          or as a boilerplate, by cloning Plume's source code and starting from there.
        </dd>

      <dt>♿ &nbsp; Accessible</dt>
        <dd>
          The outlines were preserved. The open architecture lets you freely to apply accessible best pratices and semantic HTML, 
          and Plume has a ready made Accessible Custom Theme that you can toggle on your apps. 
        </dd>
  
      <dt>✪ &nbsp; Unopinionated architecture</dt>
        <dd>
          There is no html imposition, just pure and simple elements style. You decide your html architecture.
          You decide how to code your design. You have all the responsability, also all the freedom.
        </dd>
    </dl>
